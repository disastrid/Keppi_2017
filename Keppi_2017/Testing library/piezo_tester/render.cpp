Piezo strike to WAV file playback
--------------------------------

This sketch shows how to playback audio samples from a buffer using
onset detection of strikes detected by a piezo sensor.

An audio file is loaded into a buffer `SampleData` as `gSampleData`. This is 
accessed with a read pointer that is incremented at audio rate within the render 
function: `out += gSampleData.samples[gReadPtr++]`.

Note that the read pointer is stopped from incrementing past the length of the 
`gSampleData`. This is achieved by comparing the read pointer value against the 
sample length which we can access as follows: `gSampleData.sampleLen`.

The piezo is connected to Bela through a simple voltage divider circuit.

- Connect a 1.8 MOhm resistor between the positive (red) and negative (black) leads of the piezo
- Also connect the negative side to ground
- Connect analog input 0 to the positive side
- Connect another 1.8 MOhm resistor between positive and 3.3V

In order to get a coherent trigger from the piezo disk we have to go through a few stages of 
signal taming. The first is a DC offset filter which recentres the signal around 0. This is necessary
as our voltage divider circuit pushes the piezo input signal to half the input voltage range, 
allowing us to read the piezo's full output.

As a piezo disk behaves like a microphone it outputs both negative and positive values. A second
step we have to take before detecting strikes is to fullwave rectify the signal, this gives us only
positive values.

Next we perform the onset detection. We do this by looking for a downwards trend in the sensor data
after a rise. Once we've identified this we can say that a peak has occured and trigger the sample
to play. We do this by setting `gReadPtr = 0;`.

This type of onset detection is by no means perfect. Really we should lowpass filter the 
piezo signal before performing the onset detection algorithm and implement some kind of 
debounce on the stikes to avoid multiple strikes being detected for a single strike.
